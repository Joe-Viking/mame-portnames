Recent versions of MAME come with a Lua plugin called 'portname', developed by cracyc.

This plugin renames input port names with more descriptive ones. This makes setting up controls in MAME nicer, and also gives the player an overview of the game's controls at a glance.

This plugin needs data to work, which is present in this repository, in the form of json formatted documents.
